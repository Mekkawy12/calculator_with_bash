Calculator using Terminal User Interface

•       this is our bash scripting project (Calculator using TUI)

•       The Calculator has Three Modes:-

o       Standard Mode
o       Scientific Mode
o       Programmer Mode


1.      Standard Mode

•       The most basic Mode is the (four-function calculator), which can perform basic arithmetic such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

•       Four-function calculators usually have a ( +, -, x and / ) sign to denote the operations and can produce numbers.

2.      Scientific Mode

•       As its name suggests, the scientific calculator is designed for performing scientific calculations.

•       This type of calculator usually has more buttons (Functions) than a standard calculator, as it needs to be able to perform trigonometric functions, logarithms, sine/cosine and exponential operations.

•       The main Functions of Scientific Mode is { sine Function, Cosine Function, The tangent function (Tan) and The MOD Function}



3.      Programmer Mode

•       Programmer Mode are the mode that can automatically carry out a sequence of operations under control of a stored program.

•       Programmer mode has (Three Main Operations)

•       Bit Shift Operations
•       Bitwise Operations
•       Base Converter Operations

A.      ( Bit Shift Operations )

•       A bit-shift moves each digit in a number’s binary representation left or right. Within right-shifts.
•       there are two further divisions: ( logical right-shift and arithmetic right-shift.

•       A left-shift is represented by the << operator, while a right-shift is represented by the >> operator.

B.Bitwise Operations

•       A bitwise operation is executed on a binary number, which can also be seen as a string of bits.

•       The bitwise calculator can perform 6 different bitwise operations: ( bitwise AND, bitwise OR, bitwise XOR, bitwise Not, bitwise NAND, bitwise NOR)

o       Bitwise AND: The corresponding bit of the result is 1 if both input numbers have a 1 on this bit; otherwise, it is 0.
o       Bitwise OR: The corresponding bit of the result is 1 if at least one input number has a 1 on this bit; otherwise, it is 0.
o       Bitwise XOR/exclusive OR: The corresponding bit of the result is 1 if one and only one input number has a 1 on this bit; otherwise, it is 0.


C.BASE Converter Operations
•       Convert between Decimal (base 10) and BINARRY (BASE 2)
•       Convert between Decimal (base 10) and Octal (BASE 8)
•       Convert between Decimal (base 10) and Hexadecimal (BASE 16)
